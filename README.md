# Chemistry-Assistant

# About
This is a school project aimed at creating a Chemistry Assistant to help students visualize element properties and perform simple chemical calculations. The project aims to provide students with an interactive
tool that will enable them to explore and understand various chemical concepts more easily. Through this Chemistry Assistant, students will have access to a wealth of information on elements and their properties,
including atomic number, mass, and electronegativity. They will also be able to perform calculations such as molarity, molality, and percent composition, among others. The overall goal of this project is to make 
chemistry more accessible and engaging for students, helping them to develop a deeper understanding of the subject.
